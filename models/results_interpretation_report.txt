SYMBOLIC REGRESSION RESULTS INTERPRETATION
==================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
• Template-based method achieved best R² = 0.674
• PySR AI-driven method achieved best R² = 0.589
• Template-based approach outperformed PySR in this case
• This suggests the true relation is close to our physical templates

BEST DISCOVERED EXPRESSIONS:
------------------------------
Template-Based Winner:
  Expression: a + b * log_v
  R² = 0.674, RMSE = 0.859
  Physics: Linear TF (log v)

PySR Winner:
  Expression: -13.359211 - ((x0 * 4.0909696) - (x5 * 0.0010119425))
  R² = 0.589, RMSE = 0.933
  Physics: PySR Discovery #7

PHYSICS INTERPRETATION:
-------------------------
The Tully-Fisher relation M = a + b*log(v) was successfully rediscovered.
This confirms our simulation contains the expected physics.

Template success suggests:
• The physical form we expected is correct
• Hidden systematics are minimal or well-captured
• Simple parametric forms are sufficient

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
-----------------------------------
1. Tune PySR hyperparameters for better performance
2. Increase population size and iterations
3. Add more operators (sin, cos, exp, etc.)
4. Include domain-specific constraints
5. Use multi-objective optimization (accuracy + simplicity)
